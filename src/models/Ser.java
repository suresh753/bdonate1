/* 
 * Java is the primary programming language used when building for Android,
 * and this quiz is designed to warm-up your Java programming skills:
 * 
 * There are some missing elements from Human.java and Superhero.java 
 * (see tabs above this window for details) that we could use your help to complete! 
 *
 * --TASK OVERVIEW--
 * In Human.java:
 * - Implement the Comparable Interface using the age field as the differentiator.
 * In Superhero.java:
 * - Extend the class Superhero as a subclass of Human.
 * - Add a String field that stores the hero's alter ego.
 * - Modify the given constructor by adding the alter ego as an additional parameter
 *   and setting it.
 * - Override the introduce() method to ALSO return the alter ego.
 *
 * Feel free to this use space as a sandbox to get started:
 * - Create some Humans and Superheroes.
 * - Have them introduce themselves.
 * - Sort Them!
 * 
 * We recommend testing your code via the "Test Run" button, and
 * submit your completed code with the "Submit" button when you're ready!
 *
 * You can submit as many times as you'd like. There is no penalty 
 * for multiple submissions; the quiz will only retain your most 
 * recent submission.
